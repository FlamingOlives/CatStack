- Before creating a new issue, check if a similar one has already been reported.
- Clearly describe the issue, including steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and actual behavior.
- Use appropriate labels and assign the issue to yourself if you intend to work on it.

## Pull Requests

- Make sure you have forked the repository.
- Create a new branch for your work: `git checkout -b your-feature`.
- Keep your branch up to date with the main repository: `git pull origin main`.
- Make your changes and commit them following the [commit message guidelines](#commit-message-guidelines).
- Push your changes to your fork: `git push origin your-feature`.
- Create a Pull Request (PR) from your branch to the main repository.
- In your PR, provide a clear description of the changes made and reference the related issue (e.g., "Closes #123").

## Coding Guidelines

CatStack follows coding guidelines which can be found in [CODING_GUIDELINES.md](CODING_GUIDELINES.md). Please make sure to follow these guidelines when contributing code.

## Commit Message Guidelines

Please follow these guidelines when writing commit messages:

- Use a clear and concise message.
- Start with a verb in the present tense (e.g., "Add," "Fix," "Update").
